Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment that presents new challenges every day that also nurtures talent and emphasizes collaboration?\n\n\nWithin Flight Centre Travel Group (FCTG) Australia, we are seeking a highly motivated Data Modeller with experience in logical/conceptual data design, semantic layer modelling, and data stewardship to take on the challenge of transforming how FCTG manages and shares critical information assets.\n\n\nIn this role you will provide a graphical representation of the entities that interoperate within the organisation in support of the organisation business processes and the relationships among these entities. You will be responsible for developing the data models. They transform business information into models by engaging with the business users and soliciting their requirements and iteratively refine the conceptual, logical, and physical data models.
